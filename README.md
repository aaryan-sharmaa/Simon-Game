# Simon-Game
"Simon Game" is an engaging web development project created as part of the "Delta" course at "Apna College." This interactive game is inspired by the classic "Simon Says" memory game. Players must follow the sequence of colors and sounds generated by the system. The game tests and enhances players' memory and concentration skills.

The rules of the game are simple:

► Follow and remember the patterns the game shows.
► Repeat the pattern correctly to move to the next level.
► As you progress, the game becomes more challenging!
